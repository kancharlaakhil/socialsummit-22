Ashneer Grover's talk wasn't just about shaking things up; it was a crash course in how to actually do it. The hands-on experiences weren't just about hearing fancy concepts; they were about living and breathing change. Walking away from the summit, I'm not just motivated; I've got a mindset ready to shake things up. Kudos to the organizers for pulling off an event that goes beyond talk, sparking a genuine call to action.",

The on-stage events, especially the Nukkad Natak and Sociothon, proved how thinking outside the box can tackle societal problems. This event lit a fire in me for making positive changes, and I'm grateful to have been part of such an inspiring and open-minded gathering. Excited to see the impact it'll surely have on our society.",
